# Installation

For now, halodrops is not a `pip` or `conda` package.
You can either clone the repository by

```
git clone git@github.com:Geet-George/halodrops.git
```

and run

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
or
```
mamba env create -f environment.yml
```
from the folder directory to install halodrops in development mode,

or you can directly install the package from github using pip
