# Post-flight Operations

Data from the dropsondes launched during the flight can be transferred out of the AVAPS computer in two ways:

    1. By plugging in a USB stick into the USB port on the front side of the HRDS rack.
    2. By connecting to the AVAPS computer remotely via FTP. FileZilla can be used to drag and drop data from AVAPS in the aircraft to a local PC. The IP address and password must be known to access AVAPS remotely.
